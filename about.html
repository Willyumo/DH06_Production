                    🎨 Who I Am
                <p class="p-section">
                    Hi, I'm Willyum Oliver — a photographer and digital creative with a passion for capturing meaningful moments and turning them into stunning visuals.
                <br>

                    📷 How It Started
                <p class="p-section">
                    My love for photography began in middle school, chasing my neighbors around with a camera as they skateboarded. There was something magical about freezing action mid-air or catching that perfect expression — poster-worthy moments that told a story.

                    🌟 What I Do
                <p class="p-section">
                    I specialize in lifestyle, portrait, and nature photography, as well as brand visuals and custom digital content creation. I'm always open to experimenting, but my favorite styles lean toward vibrant colors with high contrast, noir, and retro aesthetics.

                    🧠 Creative Philosophy
                <p class="p-section">
                    When you hire me, expect high-quality work with a thoughtful, intentional approach. My turnaround may be slower — not rushed — because I aim to deliver more than a photo; I want to give you a timeless memory. One you’ll want to frame, save, and revisit with admiration.

                    🏞️ Experience
                <p class="p-section">
                    I've covered a variety of events and worked with diverse groups — including birthday parties, conventions, class reunions, and graduations. I love being part of moments that matter to people.

                    📍 Where I Work
                <p class="p-section">
                    I’m based in South Carolina and frequently work in Myrtle Beach, Columbia, and Charleston. I'm also open to projects near the North Carolina border, like Charlotte. Have a different location in mind? Reach out through the Contact Me page and let’s talk.

                    🐾 A Bit More About Me
                <p class="p-section">
                    I have a tall, gold-and-white pitbull who’s like a son to me — and yes, you’ll probably spot him in some of my work. I’m also a proud graduate of the University of South Carolina.
